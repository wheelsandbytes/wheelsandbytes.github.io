# WHAT'S GOOGLE YO

For the sake of the sanity of the people who ask non-redundant questions on the CVN Facebook community page, here is a list of things that gets asked all the time by those who are too lazy to Google basic information that has been on [CrownVic.net](http://www.crownvic.net/) for the last 16 years...

<div class="container">

This is what happens when you actually use Google for research...

### GEAR RATIOS

PSA to CVN FB: I will make an example out of you and stick it on this page if you ask this simple question again.

</div>

We have Google and [crownvic.net](http://www.crownvic.net) at our disposal...what excuse could you possibly have for taking time out of your day to tell us that you know nothing about the topic instead of researching it...

Anyway, here are just a few links to CV.net:

* [Road Test Results; 2.73 vs 3.27 vs 3.55 vs DOHC MM](http://www.crownvic.net/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=2344535)
* [3.55 DRIVESHAFT - NEED HELP, PLEASE!](http://www.crownvic.net/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=1309821&amp;page=0#Post1309821)
* [AXLE--3.27 vs. 3.55 vs. 3.73](http://www.crownvic.net/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=40231)

There. Now you have no excuse not to know.

Also, if you express concern about gas mileage and you drive a Panther, please leave the Facebook page and go buy this:

</div>


Moving right along...

### COLD AIR INTAKES
Stop asking if aftermarket cold air intakes will increase your performance. They will not. The best intake for a Panther with the stock 4.6L 2V V8 is the 04+ CVPI intake/airbox/MAF setup. NO, K&amp;N cone filters will not give you +20hp. Just, STAHP.

### OIL

I don't understand how this could be any simpler...Do people not read the owner's manual or instructions for anything that they own?

<div class="container">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://wheelsandbytes.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/fb-cvn-whats-a-great-oil.png" alt="fb cvn whats a great oil"  />
</div>

_"What's a great oil."_ Was that supposed to be a question.

Here's a tip: READ THE OWNER'S MANUAL.

<div class="container">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://wheelsandbytes.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/5w-20-motorcraft-owners-manual.png" alt="5w-20 motorcraft owners manual.png" />
</div>

_"idk guys i been using [amsoil/royal purple/castrol/mobil1/etc/etc] for x years and never had any problems"_

And? The Ford engineers designed this engine to work with this Motorcraft oil. Stop trying to be smarter than the engineers. Why would you use more expensive synthetic motor oil in a car that was literally designed to use this particular synthetic blend motor oil? If you really don't want to follow the owner's manual and consider yourself a rebel, then... I really don't know what to tell you.

### SUSPENSION

Lowering: STOP ASKING GENERIC QUESTIONS LIKE "hurr durr how did u lower ur car??"
We did it by using Google and spending a bit of money. There are coilovers out there for our cars. [I'll link you to Naake's site as a start](http://www.naake.com/store/mercury-marauder), but you're on your own from there. And if you whine about existing coilovers being too expensive, go make your own setup. No one will make a cheap set because there's little demand for that in the Panther community. Not every grandpa wants his MGM or LTC slammed and riding like a drift car.

Here's one of the many lowering threads on CV.net: [Any pics of the 1.5 inch drop springs on a panther](http://www.crownvic.net/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=2277450&amp;page=1)

If you're dying for a set of proper coilovers, [contact BC Racing NA on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BCRacingNA/?fref=ts) or go to their website at [BC Racing North America](http://www.bcracing-na.com) and spam them for Crown Victoria coilovers. If you ask, you'll be directed to them.

Air suspension: If you do not have at least $1k burning a hole in your pocket, please don't ask about air suspension builds. In case you're drowning in cash and want to build a proper IRS air setup, here's a thread for inspiration:

* [Dropping a 00cvpi (air ride+IRS swap)](http://www.crownvic.net/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=2030254&amp;page=1)
If you have the motivation to do an air setup, you'll research everything you need to know on your own.

### GRAMMAR

This whole page needs to revisit elementary school. I've seen first graders do a better job with punctuation than some of the posts I see on CVN Facebook page. It's difficult to read quickly and correctly the first time around when you're that lazy. I will post examples of such extreme laziness. And if you tell me "well this is fb not a f****** classroom [blah blah blah insert whining here]" I'm just going to ignore you. It's really not that difficult to use the comma, question mark, and period keys on your keyboard every once in a while...

<div class="container">
    <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-402" src="https://wheelsandbytes.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/screen-shot-2016-02-26-at-12-18-23-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-26 at 12.18.23 PM" width="498" height="176" />
</div>

I don't even see a question mark anywhere in this post...

<div class="container">
    <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-430" src="https://wheelsandbytes.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/fb-cvn-carlos-strikes-again.png" alt="fb cvn carlos strikes again" width="450" />
</div>

Carlos strikes again...

<div class="container">

</div>

...if you don't know how to research which tools you need to work on your car...I don't know what to tell you...

</div>

Carlos strikes yet again. What is he even saying?
