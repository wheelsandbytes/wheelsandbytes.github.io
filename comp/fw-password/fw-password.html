* You need a macOS installer from the Mac App Store. Yosemite and up should suffice. It's normally located in the /Applications folder.

* Right-click on the installer and select "Open package contents"

* Find `InstallESD.dmg` in `Contents/SharedSupport/`

* Double-click `InstallESD.dmg` to open it.

* You'll need to show macOS hidden files in order to get to the Firmware Password Utility. Press `shift+command+period` on your keyboard, and you will see a bunch of files suddenly show in OS X Install ESD.

* Double-click on `BaseSystem.dmg` to open it.

* Now we can open the Firmware Password Utility. You can find it in `Applications/Utilities/Firmware Password Utility.app`
