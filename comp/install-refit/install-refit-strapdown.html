# How to install rEFIt on an external USB drive

---

## Basically [this](http://refit.sourceforge.net/doc/c1s1_install.html) with pretty pictures.

### 1. Download rEFIt from [here](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/refit/rEFIt-0.14.dmg?download).

Type `diskutil list` and press enter

Should like something like this:

The USB disks are always at the bottom. You can see mine is listed as:

In most cases, the `IDENTIFIER` for your USB flash drive is something else. In my case, it is `disk3`

_Make sure to note your correct `IDENTIFIER`, otherwise u gon erase the wrong disk._

### 6. Erase USB flash drive using Terminal

In Terminal, type `diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ "USB" GPT /dev/disk3` but replace `disk3` with _your_ `IDENTIFIER`. Press enter. POOF there goes your data.

It gon look like dis:

### 7. Copy the "efi" folder to the USB drive

Recall that our USB flash drive was renamed to `USB` in the erase process.

In Terminal, type `cp -R /Volumes/rEFIt/efi /Volumes/USB` and press enter

Then, `cd /Volumes/USB/efi/refit/` and press enter

Then, `sudo ./enable.sh` and press enter

YOUR PASSWORD AIN'T GONNA SHOW but type it in and press enter anyway. Why? Because UNIX.

Should look like this:

### Done.

Eject the USB flash drive like you normally would, then reboot your Mac while holding the option key, and you should see rEFIt as an option.
